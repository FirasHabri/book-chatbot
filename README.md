## Pre-requisites : 
- For handeling users intents : 
  - [NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit)!](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)
  - [TensorFlow!](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)
- For getting the Named Entities :
  - [TensorFlow!](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/)
  - [Numpy!](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- For Connection to the Server and Messenger API :
  - [Flask!](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
  - [PyMessenger!](https://pypi.org/project/pymessenger/)
  
## How it works :
This Bot contains three trained machine leaning models :
* Intent classification and prediction.
* Names Entity recognition.
* Knowledge based recommender system.

The first model is used to predict what the customer wants when asking a question. The second model will recognize the authors name, the book title and its category. The final model is a Rule based recommender to recommend books based on the user choices.
